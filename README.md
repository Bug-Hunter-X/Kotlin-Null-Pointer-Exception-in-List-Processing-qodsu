This repository contains a simple Kotlin program demonstrating a potential null pointer exception when working with lists.  The `bug.kt` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.kt` provides a corrected version with robust null handling.  The issue is particularly relevant when dealing with lists that could potentially contain null values, a situation not explicitly handled in the original code. The solution showcases how to effectively use Kotlin's null safety features to prevent crashes.
